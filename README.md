## 📂 Contents

### 🧪 Written Assignment (INL1): Comparison of the performance of different supervised models
- **Deadline**: 2 Dec 2024  
- **Credits**: 1.5 ECTS
- **Objective**: Compare the performance of various supervised learning models on a dataset.
- **Main Topics**:
  - Data preprocessing
  - Train/test splitting
  - Supervised models (e.g., KNN, Decision Trees, SVM)
  - Model evaluation and comparison
- **Tools**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

### 🧪 Written Assignment (INL2): Problem solving with unsupervised learning
- **Deadline**: 16 Dec 2024  
- **Credits**: 1 ECTS
- **Objective**: Solve a problem using unsupervised learning techniques.
- **Main Topics**:
  - Clustering (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)
  - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
  - Evaluation of clustering performance
- **Tools**: Scikit-learn, Seaborn, NumPy

### 🧪 Written Assignment (INL3): Neural networks and Deep learning
- **Deadline**: 30 Dec 2024  
- **Credits**: 2 ECTS
- **Objective**: Implement and evaluate neural networks for solving classification or regression problems.
- **Main Topics**:
  - Basic neural networks
  - Deep learning architectures
  - Model training and evaluation
- **Tools**: TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib

### 🚀 Final Project: Machine Learning Project - Predicting Driver Surprise with Machine Learning Models

- **Objective**: Predict whether a driver experiences surprise based on behavioral and contextual driving features.
- **Dataset**: SimuSafe - "Feature Track" dataset.
- **Problem Statement**: Build a binary classification model where "yes" indicates driver surprise and "no" indicates no surprise.
- **Approach**:
  - Data preprocessing and feature selection ("dummy," "straight," "traffic," "hurry," "habituation")
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Supervised learning models (K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression)
  - Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC
- **Findings**:
  - Models performed better at predicting "no surprise" than "surprise," suggesting dataset imbalance.
  - "Traffic" and "hurry" were identified as important predictive features.
- **Tools**: Python, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
